# **Welcome to the Plant Reproductive Physiology Lab!** 

### **Research**
#### My overall research interest is understanding how plants adjust their carbon and nutrient (macro- and micro-) metabolism and nutrient allocation during high temperature stress conditions and how this influences their fertilization process and ultimately fruit and seed production.  
<br>

#### *Research program aims:*
1) To understand how anthers adjust their carbon metabolism under high temperature stress
2) To determine if and how macro- and micronutrient metabolism in anthers contribute to thermotolerance 
3) To identify key players involved in anther thermotolerance using single-cell RNA-sequencing
